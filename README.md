# gaggibot

A post-shot companion for [GaggiMate](https://gaggimate.eu) espresso machines.

I kept forgetting to log my shots. Not for lack of caring — but after every
shot the ritual was: pull out the phone, open the web UI, find Shot History,
tap edit, type everything in. Most days that didn't happen, and by 23:47,
lying in bed, the grind setting of today's best shot was gone for good.

gaggibot turns the workflow around: when a shot finishes, the machine messages
*you* and asks the few things you'd otherwise forget — rating, taste, beans,
grind, doses. Thirty seconds of tapping while you sip. The answers are written
straight back into GaggiMate's own Shot Notes, exactly as if you'd typed them
into the web UI.

## What it does

- Watches the machine over its WebSocket API and detects finished brew shots
  (backflush/descale/flush runs and anything under 10 s are ignored).
- Runs a short questionnaire via **Telegram** or **Discord** (Matrix planned),
  with one-tap "same as last shot" defaults for beans, grind and dose.
- Saves the answers into the machine's shot history — GaggiMate stays the
  source of truth, with or without gaggibot.
- Optionally archives every shot (`.slog` + notes), your brew profiles and
  machine settings (credentials redacted) to a git repository after each shot.
- Generates a static **shot journal** from that archive, ready for GitHub
  Pages. Because the journal lives outside the machine, it survives firmware
  updates and downgrades, a dying SD card, or a water-damaged machine.
- Ships a standalone `.slog` decoder (`gaggibot decode shot.slog --csv`).

## The shot journal

[Live example](https://alexnly.github.io/GAGGIMATE-0614/) — every shot with
the familiar combined pressure/flow/temperature chart, phase markers, ratings
and notes.

## Install

### Docker

```bash
mkdir gaggibot && cd gaggibot
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexNly/gaggibot/main/docker-compose.example.yml
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
# edit: machine host, bot token, chat id
docker compose up -d
```

Images are multi-arch (`amd64` + `arm64`, so a Raspberry Pi works):
`ghcr.io/alexnly/gaggibot:latest`. There is no cloud service behind this —
the bot needs to run on something in your home network that is always on.
A Pi Zero 2 W and a USB charger is the whole data center.

### pip

```bash
pip install "gaggibot[telegram] @ git+https://github.com/AlexNly/gaggibot"
gaggibot run
```

### NixOS (flake)

```nix
inputs.gaggibot.url = "github:AlexNly/gaggibot";

services.gaggibot = {
  enable = true;
  machineHost = "192.168.1.50";
  environmentFile = "/etc/secrets/gaggibot";  # TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=... / TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...
  dataRepo = "/var/lib/gaggimate-journal";    # optional
};
```

## Setup

1. Telegram: create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
   (`/newbot`), copy the token. Message your bot once, then read your chat id
   from `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`.
   Discord: create an application + bot, invite it to a server, enable the
   *message content* intent, copy the channel id.
2. Point `GAGGIBOT_MACHINE_HOST` at your GaggiMate. A DHCP reservation is more
   reliable than `gaggimate.local`.
3. Pull a shot.

## Chat commands

Besides the post-shot questionnaire, the bot answers commands (any messenger):

```
/wake     turn the machine on — pings you when it's at temperature
/sleep    back to standby
/status   mode, boiler temperature, water level
/last     the last logged shot (with journal link if configured)
/fix      redo the questionnaire for the last shot
/help     list commands
```

## Configuration

Environment variables, or the same keys in `~/.config/gaggibot/config.toml`:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GAGGIBOT_MACHINE_HOST` | `gaggimate.local` | GaggiMate hostname/IP |
| `GAGGIBOT_MESSENGER` | `telegram` | `telegram` or `discord` |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | — | Telegram credentials |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` / `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | — | Discord credentials |
| `GAGGIBOT_DATA_REPO` | — | Path to a git clone; enables archive + journal |
| `GAGGIBOT_SITE_TITLE` | `Shot Journal` | Title of the generated journal |
| `GAGGIBOT_JOURNAL_URL` | — | Public journal URL, used for `/last` deep links |
| `GAGGIBOT_STATE_DIR` | `~/.local/state/gaggibot` | Bot state (defaults, resume) |
| `GAGGIBOT_MIN_SHOT_S` | `10` | Ignore shots shorter than this |
| `GAGGIBOT_IGNORE_PROFILES` | `(?i)backflush\|descale\|flush\|clean` | Profile regex to skip |

## CLI

```
gaggibot run                 # the bot (--replay frames.jsonl --dry-run to test)
gaggibot decode SHOT.slog    # .slog -> JSON (--csv for CSV)
gaggibot sitegen shots/ -o docs/ --title "My Shot Journal"
gaggibot sync                # one-off journal sync (shots, profiles, settings, site)
```

## Publishing your journal on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repo for your data, clone it where gaggibot runs, set
   `GAGGIBOT_DATA_REPO` to the clone.
2. On GitHub: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / `/docs`.
3. Every shot now updates `https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## How it talks to the machine

Local network only — nothing leaves your LAN except the messenger API and
your own git remote. Requires GaggiMate firmware ≥ v1.7 (binary shot logs).

- `ws://<machine>/ws` — `evt:status` for shot detection,
  `req:history:notes:save` for notes, `req:profiles:list` for backup
- `GET /api/history/index.bin`, `<id>.slog`, `<id>.json` — shot downloads
- `GET /api/settings` — settings backup; WiFi/AP/Home-Assistant credentials
  are redacted before anything is written to disk

The `.slog` v5 binary format (512-byte header, 26-byte samples at 250 ms) is
documented in [`src/gaggibot/slog.py`](src/gaggibot/slog.py).

### WhatsApp?

There is no reasonable self-hosted WhatsApp bot API. Two workable paths:
bridge your Telegram/Matrix chat via [mautrix](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/),
or Meta's WhatsApp Business Cloud API (requires a business account). Native
support: contributions welcome.
